Code to reproduce experiments from "A Targeted Accuracy Diagnostic for Variational Approximations" (AISTATS 2023)<br>
---
- To run the experiments, first, run the following scripts:<br>
    - hypothesis_test.py<br>
    - parallel_mh.py<br>
    - plot_confidence_region.py<br>
    - proposal.py<br>
    - utils.py<br>
- Experiments:<br>
    - Gaussian - correlated Gaussian model.
    - Neal - Neal-funnel shape model.
    - Cancer-calssification - Sparse logistic regression on cancer classification dataset.
    - Candy-power 
        - Logistic regression on candy-power dataset.
        - Bayesian Neural Network on candy-power dataset.
