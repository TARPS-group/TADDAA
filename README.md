# TADDAA
Code to reproduce experiments from "A Targeted Accuracy Diagnostic for Variational Approximations" (AISTATS 2023)
Experiments:
    Gaussian - correlated Gaussian model.
    Neal - Neal-funnel shape model.
    Candy-power - Logistic regression on candy-power dataset.
                - Bayesian Neural Network on candy-power dataset.
    Cancer-calssification - Sparse logistic regression on cancer classification dataset.


The source code is written in Python language.

To run the experiments, first, run the following scripts:
    hypothesis_test.py
    parallel_mh.py
    plot_confidence_region.py
    proposal.py
    utils.py
